ColorAnalyzer is a simple and useful application for monitoring the color under the cursor on the screen. The program displays the current color in real time, filling a square with the color and showing its corresponding HEX value.

By pressing the keyboard shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + C, the HEX color code is copied to the clipboard, allowing you to easily use it in other applications or processes.

This app is perfect for designers, developers, or anyone who needs to quickly grab color codes for digital work.
